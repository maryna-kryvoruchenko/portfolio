            <h3>My Style</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I enjoy setting both short term and long terms goals. I believe that a person can be more productive and accountable if they set up goals. </li>
                <li>Communication is key! If there are questions, ask them right away to move on with the projects. </li>
                <li>I enjoy working for a set period of time and taking small breaks for the mind to cool down. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What I value</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Honesty is important in any setting or situation.</li>
                <li>When people are willing to explore and brainstorm. Sometimes it is hard to start from scratch. The keyword is “start”! Find inspiration, discover what you would like to work on the most, and seek help. </li>
                <li>I value acknowledging the work. During presentations, or even casual conversations, don’t be afraid to give a compliment; it motivates each to keep working hard.</li>
                <li>I love when people find their passion. Whether it is a hobby or a career – discover things that you want to keep learning about and develop.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What I don't have patience for</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If life gets hard and you don’t have time to reach a certain goal, reach out for some help instead of quietly/secretly worrying about it on your own. </li>
                <li>I don’t appreciate overthinking. There can be confusions, misunderstandings, or miscommunication. There is no need to overthink – ask! Get to know people around you to decrease a number of such moments. </li>
                <li>Conflict is my enemy. I don’t appreciate disrespect and believe that things can be resolved without fighting. Be patient and listen to the person you disagree with, compromise.</li>
                <li>Dream and make plans, but also enjoy the moment. Today is not going to repeat. Make it memorable and enjoyable. Build memories. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How best to communicate with me</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emails are preferrable when it comes to work and team projects. I check my inbox constantly and will reach back soon. </li>
                <li>Don’t be afraid to talk in person. That way we can resolve the problem a lot faster. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to help me</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t expect me to keep track of every responsibility even if I’m the leader. Do your best and I will help you with the rest. </li>
                <li>I love new tasks! If there are new ideas for creating or improving, don’t hold back.</li>
                <li>Sometimes I can’t think of answers on the spot, give me time or explain and I’ll catch on to it quickly. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What people misunderstand about me</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Although I enjoy working in teams, sometimes I need to work on my own to “recharge.” Please don’t accept me as anti-social; I am always there to communicate with you. </li>
                <li>My opinions are strong, but I am often times willing to compromise. </li>
